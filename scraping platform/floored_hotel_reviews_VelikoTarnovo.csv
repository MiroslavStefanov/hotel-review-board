1893,2445,Gile Guest House,"Hotel Gile is a real gem!  The hosts, Emil & Lily, and their young son, were amazing - so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Even though we arrived quite late Emil welcomed us with a smile, he gave us a city map and pointed out all the main places to see and gave us suggestions of where to eat.  The location is brilliant - close enough to walk to all the main sights but far enough away to be quiet at night.  There are 2 flights of steps at the side of the hotel and 10 minutes walk to the centre.  There are several restaurants just a few minutes‚Äô walk to the main street and a minimarket (open 0600-2100) at the bottom of the steps.  It was very easy to find - as other reviews have said, google maps is wrong, but as long as you get to the intersection of Buzludzha, Hristo Karaminkov and Zielonka streets, and follow the brown signs all the way through the hospital grounds you can‚Äôt go wrong (the hotel is situated in the grounds of the hospital).  There is plenty of free parking around the building (a bonus in Veliko Tarnovo!) and it is ok to leave the car during the day.  The accommodation itself is wonderful.  It looked like it had all been recently renovated and it was spotlessly clean.    There was a very big shared kitchen/dining room for the use of all guests.  It had comfy seating and 2 tables and chairs.  The kitchen was fully equipped with oven, hob, microwave, kettle, coffee machine, 2 fridge/freezers and cupboards full of utensils and crockery.  There were even a few essentials like tea, coffee, sugar, oil, salt & pepper etc.  Our room was huge with windows on three sides, with a comfortable bed and seating area, a really pleasant place to relax.  The wifi was good and there was plenty of storage and sockets, including next to the bed.  There is no fridge or kettle in the bedroom but that is OK as you can use the shared kitchen.

Eventually we asked a local who had been looking on, and he rang someone - he obviously knew who to contact - and eventually some 45 minutes after arriving we were let in. Only to discover that our bathroom was across a corridor that people in the next room had to use to get to their room!! At least they had an ensuite.... So no privacy there. Nothing to stop water from the shower soaking the toilet and everything else when showering either. Our friends on the floor below us had exactly the same situation. The breakfast was lousy. And the host who let us in spoke no English, so communication was quite difficult. Consequently, we only stayed the one night, instead of the two we originally booked.."
