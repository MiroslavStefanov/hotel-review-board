0,0,Hotel Anna-Kristina,This is a absolutely charming historic public bath from the Ottoman era converted into a comfortable hotel right by the Danube river a short walk from the Fort and surrounded by a park.  It has parking.  We had one of the apartments which was very spacious and comfortable and nearly everything worked. It was exceptionally quiet. Staying there was a very good experience..,We were initially sent to a smaller hotel room which was not what we had booked but eventually we were transferred to the one that we had.  The reception was initially quite indifferent and abrupt but we managed to build up a better rapport by the time we left. The bath plug needs fixing as it could not be unplugged..,10.0,This is a absolutely charming historic public bath from the Ottoman era converted into a comfortable hotel right by the Danube river a short walk from the Fort and surrounded by a park.

This is not the way to make a tourism in 21 century, this is real primitivism. When I went to the back side of the hotel, since my little son wanted to go around, I did see steep stairs without being finished and very dangerous to be used, part of the metal construction sticking up, a lot of rubbish, piles of sand, gallons with liquid, etc. This is not a normal place where tourists should go and moreover this hotel should be inspected immediately. After having a chat to the people in the town I was told that the owner serves the breakfast  himself because nobody in the town wants to work for him.... Avoid this place!."

Curtainless and rimless ""shower cubicles"" are a bit strange, but this is common in Bulgaria, as I hear it. The young lady at the reception was very kind and spoke English well. The car can only be parked in front of the hotel, next to the sidewalk, but there is a security camera in the area. Unfortunately, the breakfast was not of good quality and there was little. Overall, I recommend this hotel. Perfect for a day's accommodation, although the area is a bit depressing (concrete block houses). The hotel is within walking distance of the city center and the banks of the Danube River. The interior of the hotel and the room were very clean. The double bed mattress in our room was terribly uncomfortable. The curtainless and flangeless shower enclosure is a bit strange, but it’s common in Bulgaria, as I hear it. The young lady at the front desk was very nice and spoke good English. The car can only be parked in front of the hotel, next to the sidewalk, but the area is monitored.

Тишината нощем е невероятна, пренасяш се в друго време. Намира се в края на селото и наоколо са поля. Небето е обсипано със звезди. Приказно е, когато идваш от големия град. В района могат да се видят редица манастири, пещери и Белоградчишките скали са наистина впечатляващи.”“A great house with a lovely garden and a big, comfortable barbecue. A very nice housewife. It's a big company. The silence at night is incredible, you're moving on to another time. It is located at the edge of the village and there are fields around. The sky is covered with stars. It's a fairy tale when you come from the big city. The area is full of monasteries, caves and Belogradchik Rocks.”.",10.0," .“Страхотна къща с прекрасна градина и голямо, удобно барбекю.
