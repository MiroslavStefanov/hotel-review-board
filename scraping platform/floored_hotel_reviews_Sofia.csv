Quite new facility with the possibility to also use the small gym in the hotel. cleaning not always exceptional (I refer in particular to the canteen area during breakfast).

Room 404 (Deluxe) does not have a safe, although it is indicated in the room description on Booking.com. Some other rooms have a safe, it is smaller than 0.5 liters of cola (see attached photo). No tablet or camera will enter there, only a passport and cash. At the reception they told me something like ""you can safely leave things in the room, they don't steal from us."" After an hour of arguments and a lot of phone calls, in the end I was allocated a reception safe, thanks to one of the workers for their ingenuity and desire to help. 3. Refrigerator and TV in the room did not work. It was not possible to drink cold water from the road. Moved the furniture, it turned out that someone turned off all the appliances from the outlet. Turned it on, everything worked. Question: Why did you turn it off? Saving electricity? UNCLEAR! 4. Requested a room with a bath, not a shower. Received as requested. I took a bath, laid out the ducks, lay down, kaefff! After a couple of minutes I look, the floor is wet. I started to check, it turned out that the bath was leaking from below, flooded the entire floor. I didn’t complain, I didn’t have the strength after the disputes about the safe. 5.

I believe these are just excuses, because  I had actually messaged the hotel via Booking.com some days before arriving requesting that I have twin beds in each rooms (purely due to the fact that there will be 2 people per room & we prefer twin beds). They replied saying that wouldn’t be a problem. They should’ve questioned me then if they thought that I had booked 1 person per room. Honestly the way hotel management treated us was very unprofessional & disrespectful. It ruined our stay in Sofia & added unnecessary stress.You’d think that the hotel manager would’ve at least apologised for the confusion but he was obviously too ashamed to speak to us after treating us so disrespectfully.."

1596,2191,Central Hotel Sofia,"Great location, one of my favorites... In a year and a half that I go to Sofia I could only say it's perfect.","Arrived after midnight, the guy at the ricepsion was very nice and solved in a midget according to our problem with the double booking. Room was clean, seen poor cleaning in Bulgarian hotels. But we had a construction site under the hotel which didn't sleep well. There was a repair on the srtada. As we spent nights there, exclusively for work, we only had change of towels. The toilet brush, which we rarely use, was all dirty.... And even after cleaning I found my hair on sanitary board, which was not mine. I found the breakfast very poor compared to other hotels even with a lower price....The breakfast staff were also distracted.

Arrived after midnight, the guy at the ricepsion was very nice and solved in a midget according to our problem with the double booking. Room was clean, seen poor cleaning in Bulgarian hotels. But we had a construction site under the hotel which didn't sleep well. There was a repair on the srtada. As we spent nights there, exclusively for work, we only had change of towels. The toilet brush, which we rarely use, was all dirty.... And even after cleaning I found my hair on sanitary board, which was not mine. I found the breakfast very poor compared to other hotels even with a lower price....The breakfast staff were also distracted.

We were able to park our car in a closed garage, but as there are limited spaces in the car park, please call the hotel in advance and make sure they are located. It would be nice to book a room via Booking.com and to cancel your room reservation for free if there is no space in the car park. Please note that the underground car park is accessible by a platform, so it is possible to ask in advance for large vehicles. It would be very helpful if they actually published the maximum vehicle sizes they could accept in the Booking.com's respective section. The rooms facing the boulevard were closed. We thought they were kept off to reduce the sound coming from the outside. We haven't spent much time in the room, so it hasn't affected us. The bed was comfortable, but the two single beds were put together. The TV wasn't working, but we didn't need it anyway."

Main course I asked for salmon which comes with mixed salad and cherry tomatoes.  Told no salad have to take cucumber which I got.  My husband had steak and with his he got grilled veg. which I was not offered.  Otherwise food good.  Monday morning breakfast good but no English tea bags had to take coffee from machine which not good quality and not hot.  Monday afternoon asked for 2 coffee lattie they were cold I informed the bar man but he did not seem to care.  Monday night in restaurant again I asked for soup starter only to be told soup only served at lunchtime even though showing on menu as starter.  Other food we ordered good.  After dinner I asked barman for 2 Jameson whiskeys and a glass of tap water.  He gave me a glass of hot water.  I pointed out to him that when I asked him for coffee early on day he gave me cold and when I asked for cold water he gave me hot and did he not know the difference between hot and col.  He worked in London number of years and speaks perfect English so no excuse.  I think not enough staff and barman had to do waiter and under pressure to do both.  All staff are very pleasant and helpful and first time I could say anything wrong,."

They send a private taxi who was extremely unhelpful ( did not unload my three suitcases but i had to do it myself); who was unprofessional ( while i was in the taxi waiting to leave for about 10 min. the driver was chatting with someone. I kindly asked to drive me to the hotel, due to late time 2:15 am and my long flight, but the driver reverted back aggressively that it’s not his business that I’m tired!!! I have not met such a rude, arrogant and unprofessional driver and i would recommend to be avoided ( his car taxi number is 602, yellow taxi company). First impressions is very important thus i recommend the hotel for the same of preserving its reputation and clients to not delegate its transfer services to unreliable drivers.."

This hotel as a whole left a good impression: a clean room, fresh linen - that goes without saying. This information is rather a note to network managers. Little things disappointed, and the devil, as you know, lies precisely in them. I was very upset by the dirty toilet on the ground floor near the reception.

I thought it may have happened on my previous visit to this hotel as the car park was busy then and cars were being moved around by staff. This time it was not busy and I parked in front of the hotel, with plenty of space around me, and I have no idea how anyone could have hit the car, but they did. Not the hotels fault, or the staffs, but be warned when parking. It cost me a few hundred leva for the damage even though it was not my fault. The hotel staff did not want to disturb me when it happened and so I didn't find out until the early hours when I was checking out. Due to this I did not meet the offender, although he left his details. It then added an extra half hour on to my journey because I had to fill in a form which I had not accounted for. After an already stressful week of cancelled buses, hence the journey via rental car, and last minute expensive express PCR test to enter New York, I was hoping to relax on the drive to Begrade.

The carpet stains remained thought ! when I asked whether I would be reimbursed for the smaller room which seems like their single room I was told that this is what I originally booked. Strange considering the size and the amenities.. What I didn't like is that the room advert and pictures looked like this is a fresh and upkept modern hotel in the heart of Sofia. It is not really. Although central it is a long walk from NDK. .Also apart from the lobby which is renovated the rooms are tired, old and nothing but fresh, and in my opinion definitely not worth 45-50 euros per night. Not enough pillows, the beds are extremely soft and uncomfortable. For the same amount one can stay in a better hotel in the center of Sofia.."

It took me about 5 minutes to wake him. When he saw me finally he confirmed that he works here and then turned the other way and tried to go back to sleep, refusing to check me in or help in any way and telling me to come back the next day. He wouldn’t even look at the reservation that I kept showing to him on my phone- that I had a room reserved and paid for and just kept saying that he will not do anything and I need to go away and come back tomorrow after 2pm. All this time he tried to go back to sleep and not even look at me standing in front of him. To say that I was shocked and scandalized is to not say anything at all. After about 15 minutes I was able to get his attention and he reluctantly checked me in for the room that I had booked from the day prior to ensure I had a place when I land at night.
