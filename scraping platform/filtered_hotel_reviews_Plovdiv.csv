Landmark Creek Hotel & Wellness,"The room was huge, and so was the terrace..The pool was nice ... fully equipped with sun umbrellas,  chairs etc. .The food from the restaurant is mostly very good, and so is the local wine..Some staff were especially nice: the food waiter at the pool, some waiter in the restau, some staff at the reception..","We stayed 10d in the hotel, and it was a good choice..The hotel is very nicey located, an oasis with regards to the city BUT it can only be reached by car..The socialistic origin cannot neglected. The employees were mostly nice but often helpless: the perception of service is rather formal than efficient. Most of them were though very friendly; however, we as well experienced an individually rude waiter, several times..Examples: there was a desk in the room but its chair did not fit. Nobody realized that. No change possible..Similar with a beautiful sun umbrella on the terrace - its position was inadequate to provide shadow at any time but it was too massive to be moved by two guests. Would have needed staff repositioning..The room service came every day but might remove towels without replacement, several times. We figured where to find them, and the toilet paper..The reception could help with cabs, but was unsuccessful with car rental - they were very motivated, but could not. They could not advice how to reach famous places by public transport. We solved all that, using the internet and our phones, with some effort: finally, we could get a bus connection, and a car rental that could provide a car with no problem, and even cheap..The pool service cannot provide towels, but can send us to a place to ask for them. They as well did not realize the need of repositioning sun umbrellas during the day - and did not report the need to their management, maybe to find umbrellas holders that can be moved (they are very massive)..The restaurant terrace is the preferred eating place for the guests, but not so for the waiters. There was a tendency to keep the door from the restaurant closed, especially during breakfast..After 23.00, it was impossible to get a fresh beer, a glass of wine or juice, no drink. The bar is not a bar..We did not regret our choice since the hotel provided what we needed for a relaxing stay in Plovdiv..",7.9

When we addressed the issue with the rather unpleasant waitress she advised that customers were constantly complaining at the pool area of such kind of incidents, however as only men were working in the kitchen, this couldn't have been possible. To make it clear, we were at the main restaurant, not at the pool area. The hair I found was short so I couldn't judge weather it was male or female piece of hair but it was truly disgusting. On top of it, I was still charged for the dish!! At reception, the staff was equally unpleasant and unhelpful.

The bathroom door in the room is absurd, especially for children - semi-transparent with a large pipe and does not lock. (picture). Also, the outside door of the room can't be locked from the inside, and our child would leave whenever he wanted. The air conditioning in the indoor hot pools was shut down and it was so stuffy, I couldn't stand there for more than 10 minutes. Outdoor pool and tent hygiene is not very high. The children's corner is very nice, but it's definitely not a place to drop a little kid off and go to dinner - there are entrances inside the hotel and outside and the doors are always open, the kids run where they want, the animators keep them busy, but they don't take responsibility for them. Personally, I don't like the park and the pools being open to outside visitors, and the air conditioning in the room is centrally controlled. It would also be nice to have more climbing frames and swings for the youngest, as most things are for children over 5. Also, we need more benches in the park.

It was the first time I had a bathrobe stolen at a hotel spa, but the problem was that the spa reception didn't have any bathrobes or towels - they were ready in 30 minutes. That says the Governor is weak. Good thing they were the people at the spa reception who were very good professionals. Also, at check-in, the receptionist was busy buying her colleagues for RD, and she didn't explain anything at all, and at night the receptionist hung up on us and we had to call twice.

Everything inside is new and clean. Good beds. Very responsive staff.","Given the flow of tourists, there is clearly not enough parking space and it is almost impossible to find a free sun lounger in the pool on weekends and get into the sauna / hammam. Perhaps in the summer a hotel with an outdoor pool will cope with the flow of tourists, but in the cold season it is not very good. And the heated towel rail is very inconveniently located in the room - below, under the sink, it is difficult to hang bathing suits until the next day. There is a lack of floor heating and heating in the bathroom, bathrobes remain wet.

They have a fresh face, but you have to do it in a citrus press, which is ridiculous-- it was getting a huge queue and it was pretty unsanitary because everyone was touching the press and the oranges-- some with gloves, but some didn't..

The center of Plovdiv is 20 minutes away by car. There are no pedestrian roads. There are no shops around.",6.7
Park & Spa Hotel Markovo,Nice pool area...,"Also at the risk of looking as typical ""German,"" we unfortunately have to write a bad judgement about the 4(?) star hotel:..1. The entire hotel complex is in need of renovation. The flooring in the hotel, the outdoor area around the pool, the furniture in the room and the beds do not meet a 4 star standard, not even in Bulgaria! In fact, the hotel was also a major construction site, there was extensive construction work going on outside and renovation work in the hotel, e.g. there were plasterboard panels in the stairwell including leakage material to protect the stairs.....2. The breakfast buffet offered was good, but lacked plates, bowls, cutlery... The drinks machines (coffee and juice) needed a constant repair of the completely overworked staff, as the number of staff was not balanced in relation to the number of guests. The non-smoking area was admittedly only a third occupied by guests, but all the free tables were occupied with used dishes, so that only the smoking area for breakfast was left...The cleanliness throughout the food area was poor!..3. Room service did not take place all day when we arrived back to the hotel room on 27/07/17 from our trip, was asked if cleaning was possible now?!..4. The bar counter was half delivered in the evening with dirty glasses and dishes, the only barman was completely overwhelmed, but very friendly!..Conclusion: A nice hotel area, but which urgently needs organization, more staff and a renovation. A hotel being renovated and remodeled is completely normal, but why this information is not disclosed at the time of booking and why this has to happen during peak season remains the secret of hotel management.",5.4

I waited an hour for them to bring me the rest of the stuff from the minibar. The bellhop didn't take my suitcase when I got here. Dirty toilets on the first floor. Because I made a remark about these things, they won't let me in their hotel anymore. I had paid for a room in booking. For two hours, they wouldn't give me a room or the money or offer me another hotel. The hotel manager hid and I had to call the police. It's a very unpleasant experience and...",7.1

The maid was in ordinary clothes, not work clothes. Our room was never cleared. To use the iron, for some reason you need to go down to the reception and take it yourself, but the board is already being brought to the room. Why you can't bring everything together is a mystery. A similar situation with a set of towels. If you don‚Äôt get it, go to the reception for them yourself. The spa also gave out towels with difficulty.

Best Western Premier Plovdiv Hills,"Greatly well surprised by the place! Indeed, the hotel is a bit sidely situated, but not that far away form the city center (about 15-20 mins relaxing walk). The bed was very comfortable spotless cleaning but the best was the extra-mile the people working there went to satisfy a customer - I use the chance to thank them again! All my requests were met and exceeded. I will definitely be their guest again!.","Due to my alimental limitations I had to order special type of breakfast, which was done with great care, yet rather with a bit limited fantasy by the Chef. Not a complaint, but worth mentioning..If I have to point out a complaint, it will be towards the Management and pricing policy. I had to stay in the place for one more night, which I announced at the very entering to the reception desk. My stay was confirmed, but much to my surprise, as I checked the invoice, this last night was somewhere around 20% more expensive, than the other nights. And it was a Thursday night - so the place was not that busy. I am sure, thet it has been done in accordance with their internal procedures and I do not claim those 10-ish Euro, but it definitelly left me with a ""bitter feeling""..",9.0

The bathroom was divine: warm, spotless, great shower, great size - not too big but big enough even for the biggest and tallest person though I'm pretty small in size.  Breakfast was delivered to my appartment by delightful staff with a positive and jolly outlook which made the experience of receiving room service that much nicer. Breakfast was delicious, could not ask for anything better. Wifi is excellent.  I know what a great hotel appartment is because not only have I worked in the hotel industry in Italy, I have travelled to many countries and spent time in a variety of hotel appartments.

The hotel should really make an effort in that respect..2. The choice of TV programmes in foreign languages is relatively limited and seems to have been randomly made. Universal TV channels such as CNN or BBC World Service were not available while El Djazira was available. This 4 star hotel should think carefully the mix of TV programmes it proposes. .3.

Best Western Premier Plovdiv Hills,"It seems that the hotel is brand new, as some basic daily activities are yet not flawlessly organized. Breakfast is proper quality, even though it is continental type (preselection of food is separately served). Only drinks, salat and pastries on self-service. I presume there ware only a few guests, therefore it makes sense to do it that way. No need to waste food. Personnel is polite, friendly and helpful..","When we went into the room, we were hit by a massive heat wave. It was 32 degrees hot (outside temperature was around 15 degrees)! We turned on the cooling, open the window and went out. It was ok when we came back in the late evening. In the night I did not want to leave the ventilation working, since you could feel the cool wind blowing on your skin. Even the lowest level was rather aggressive. It is not nice to sleep on air conditioning, as the air dries as well. I opened the window, as it was around 10 degrees outside. We did not sleep well and when we woke up, it was again 31 degrees inside. Crazy hot. We informed the reception and they said it was because of the southern positioning of the room. I think it is nonsense with the cool weather we had. Can't imagine how it would be in the summertime. During breakfast, they went and turned the air conditioning on (which we have already done), so no solution for the night sleep. .I also disliked the pillows, which were extremely bulky and high. Maybe they have other ones on request, but I did not feel like requesting at midnight and waiting for them to arrive, before going to bed. I experienced these high pillows in other Best Western hotels in Bulgaria. It seems like they consider them ok since nothing changes. No issues of this kind when visiting Best Western abroad. .Outside parking has like 6 spots, which was enough in our case. Do not know whether there is an underground parking lot. If not, parking will become challenging. .I would wait a few years before visiting again and check the improvement as I believe I can have a more comfortable stay in the same price range elsewhere in Plovdiv..",7.5

The room was well lit and comfortably heated.","I was placed in room 501, which has a strange funnidine (trapezius) shape, with a column in the middle, which caused me great discomfort. I shared it with reception and on my next visit, I received a promise that I would be accommodated in a rectangular or square room, which I would request in advance when booking. I came across a room like this, which was for people who didn't have breakfast at the sleepover. I think that such a 'penal' policy is stressful for guests to rest. .When I arrived, and I parked outside, I asked how I could leave my car in the hotel's underground parking lot, which I received an answer to, at the moment, they had no information as to whether there were any seats available downstairs and therefore they were sitting outside. I was very tired after a lot of engagements, and I didn't have the strength to insist on parking. From the backyard, I carried a suitcase and backpack halfway across the street to get them into the hotel room, and I could have just moved, made it easy and parked like a guest in the garage. I don't know who has the number of places in the garage in question, but it is appropriate to have this information available at check-in..I shared the above two things, i.e. I'm a platinum member of the loyal program and knowing the politics of the chain, I was a little surprised at the conditions in Plovdiv. .Besides, the shower drain wouldn't flush, so I was worried about flooding the bathroom..The room description said I'd have a coffee maker, and there wasn't one. There was a hot water jug with a non-coffee two small packets..These brief remarks are beneficial, and I hope that the branch management for Bulgaria will remedy the minor irregularities in order to continue the offer of BW's quality service.",8.0

The cold was overcome thanks to the air conditioner, which was set to the maximum temperature and maximum air flow. It took about 4 hours, because. despite the maximum values, the air conditioner worked so-so (slowly). The location of the hotel is not very good, if you plan to walk towards the center on foot, you will have to spend 20 minutes to get to the central part of the city. The hotel is located near a gas station and our windows actually overlooked the gas station, so the view from the room was not very good. The biggest problem is hot water pressure. In our room 304, there was no pressure and the water was barely flowing, which made it extremely difficult to take a shower.

I've chosen a Deluxe Double Room with an extra large double bed. Unfortunately, I got two single beds, one of which had one wheel and it moved every time I turned around. It's caused me a great disappointment in my stay. The room conditions said I'd have an extra-large bed, and it wasn't...It also said there would be a coffee machine in the room, and instead a hot water kettle was set up with two small packets of non-coffee...The curtain on the bathtub in the bathroom, it had a nasty smell, which I told her at reception. It was bitten, too. I hope it changes, because it's based on the skin of every person, it stays in moisture, and there's no way it's gonna be hygienic for a long time. The bathtub itself is tall, steep and slippery...The next note is about the indoor parking - although the spaces are marked for three cars, cars with a flat registration were parked in mass and occupying two places. It is right to pay attention to the organisation of parking. As guests with a parking space included in the Deluxe Room, we barely got between the poorly arranged cars...For a 4-star hotel in the deluxe bathroom of the room, there was no toothpaste set (toothpaste) and no shaving kit...Most of the TV channels were unavailable...If these good-natured notes are taken into account by the hotel management, the stay will become fantastic, which I hope it will be.",7.0

Simple and modern design, newly renovated. Room has great AC and mini fridge..3. WIFI - worked perfect..4. Parking - they offer paid parking (10 E/day) in their yard. This is great as the location is central and all public parking spaces are paid (via SMS with Bulgarian number - not an option for foreign tourists). It's also great you can reserve the spot and be sure you have a spot for your car (this was the main reason we chose this place). Be aware you have to request the parking spot using the tool for ""request parking"" on booking, not just sending a message you want one. There are only 3 spots in the yard and for longer stays it would probably be better to stay outside the central area where there's free parking, because it would be expensive.

Otherwise, there's no parking on the street in front of the building..The apartment's not much. Cleanliness is next to godliness. There was dust on the bedroom tables, night tables and shelves in the closet. The bedrooms are not even equipped with a chair to put your clothes on. In the bathroom, the shower falls directly into the sink and everything goes into water. There's not enough hangers, and there's no hair dryer, for example. I don't include the only contact that includes the bathroom lyre, but it's on the other side of the room, which suggests your hair dryer has at least a six-foot cable..The couch in the living room smelled bad, and so did all the wardrobe space..There are generally a lot of things that are not meaningful, something that is typical of Bulgarian hospitality.

Even if a confirmed reservation with the relevant number was available, the receptionist continued to claim that ""there is no such reservation"". After another half hour of wondering, the reservation is still respected and the colleagues are staying. I had indicated in my reservations that I wanted an invoice, and I applied the company's details, even though the hotel had them from previous nights. When we left the hotel, the invoices were not ready, no one would issue them... we asked them to send them by email. Each room has its own invoice ‚Äì a strange solution that creates a gap. And there were gaps, of course.  One invoice was missing, so they had to send it in extra. Slight omissions, one might say, but you shouldn't have them in a hotel with a claim.

If it is impossible to allocate a room with a bath, if you answer that you can not respond to the request, I complained that I searched for another hotel during the free cancellation period, but this time there is no additional charge He assigned me a king room with a bath, but I was disappointed because I had a good impression of my past stay. It's up to you to say that it's a bath at most, but if you live abroad for a long time, you're looking forward to the occasional bath.",7.5

Besides, you can't exactly blackout the room. The ribbons that hold them together are worn out. Exterior lighting (LED) cannot be turned off, it stays too light all night long. There is an urgent need for a repair. No remodeling, but thorough remodeling. Painting, upholstery, curtains, carpets. In addition, the space and lighting are handled very unwisely. When you look in the mirror, you're always in your own shadow. The sprinkler sprays the walk-in shower towards the opening, making the bathroom floor very wet.

In the bathroom there was a switch really close to the shower, almost underneath it that was open and you could see the wires. Not safe!!!

The hotel is very basic and it just lacks atmosphere. It's not cozy at all and I just wanted to leave.

SABORNA 25 GUEST HOUSE,"2 minutes walk from the roman theatre and the trendy neighborhood with bars and restaurants (go to ""Tams House"" for the closest Michelin star experience we found (at not Michelin prices)). Paid parking in front (10 euros a day). The room is very large, many light levels can be adjusted with several buttons, warm led lights. Walls are made of ""mud and straw"" and all the wood is burned for conservation so there was 0 chemicals used for paint or varnish, which is impressive! Very stylish. There is also a good soundbar to play some music over Bluetooth. The TV has no HDMI cable (it has a satellite card I think), so bring one if you need..The best was the shower cabin with Turkish bath incorporated, a huge unexpected plus. Total SPA feeling after strolling through the city center for hours. The dry sauna had it's own cabin with views over the city. To turn on the Turkish sauna (we thought it was broken initially) from what I remember: press the ""light"" logo, the ""ventilation"" logo and long press start/stop (timer should be on eg. 60). Inside the shower press the blue button after 5-10 minutes heating the system!.","The small stairs is something compensated by all the plusses. All roof windows have incorporated rollup curtains but the shower was all glass so in the morning lots of light came through. The second night we put some towels over the shower window and covered the tiny bedroom window with the big decorative pillow, that allowed for a few extra hours of rest after sunrise.

The only inconvenience is the lack of parking opportunities, but once he's felt the charm of the place, you forget about it..We're impressed by the room lighting - so rich and diverse that you need to take a three-day course to learn to use it fully..The attic room is amazing for the fans!","There's only the basic three TV channels, but this is more of a good thing. Instead of watching TV, it's better to walk through the streets of Kapana and have a drink a few times in the charming pubs.",10.0

They are rude about it. Make you feel ashamed and uncomfortable because you  ask for your money back that you prepaid but you leaving early. This is ridiculous. For example if you have a reservation for 5 nights upon arrival they make you prepaid for the whole 5 nights you supposed to stay but you have to leave early for whatever reason you not getting a penny back. I don‚Äôt think this is right because sometimes people have urgent situation and they have to leave early. I think it should paid for the time you spend there and nothing more like every other normal hotel . The management of this so called hotel have they own rules that I don‚Äôt think you going to like at all. If you don‚Äôt believe you can try and good luck ..,5.8

Also the curtains were too transparent - both me and my wife were awoken at ~7am because of the sun peeking through them. The noise from the cars down the road was also noticeable - the bedroom was badly soundproofed. I definitely do not recommend the place as it did not help me get good night sleep which is the main purpose of a hotel..,6.7

I asked again to move to another room immediately to the security that was with me, he did not say anything as he was worried of him making any comments. .I feel that this was probably a very nice place to stay when first opened, but keeping standards high is probably one thing most are failing..",5.8

The air conditioning was not working at all! The kitchen draws had the instruction manuals of all the furniture which didn‚Äôt make you feel like you were staying in a residence. The bed was so uncomfortable that neither I or my partner were able to sleep. The breakfast was no good either. I was hoping that it will give us two nourishment but I ended up going upstairs and throwing up in the toilet. Another thing is the tiles in the bathroom are constructed with wood Plank. The one side where the toilet is located is not placed properly. If you stand more to one side the other side will raise up. So please be careful when staying in this apartment..",3.8

The worst is that the apartment does not have mosquito nets, so my kids got bitten multiple times, as we were not expecting mosquitos on the 9th floor and kept the windows open (as it is summer).

It's not bad at all, but the problem is, this firm doesn't allow people under 18.

I've never been to a hotel where my kids aren't allowed in a spa or gym. I've been taking them since they were little. I've traveled a lot around the world, and this is my first case.

Designers should end such practices..I have some small notes that I hope will be removed next time I visit the hotel:.- the fan-extractor was not working in the toilet - there was only half a roll of toilet paper - there was no soap, but only gel, I recommend that there be some air freshener in the room to neutralise the effects of design decisions.",8.0

Villa Antica,"The staff was very efficient in providing support for all our needs, with kindness and courtesy. Despite being a three-star hotel, they brought our luggage up: The hotel in a vintage building has no elevator, even if the stairs are not a problem. .Breakfast at the Fellini bar was more than abundant, varied and tasty. Also the staff there is very kind and nice young people.",nothing to complain about. The stay was really pleasant,9.6

Villa Antica,"The staff were extremely accommodating, the breakfast plentiful and the location was great. The value for money very cheap - you can't wish for more.",A small drawback was that it was a double bed and no separate beds were available. But for 2 nights it was tolerable because everything else has overcome this small disadvantage by far.,9.5
Villa Antica,"We were greeted extremely warmly, both at reception and at breakfast in the Dolce Fellini cafe next door. The staff speaks good English, so that the communication is not a problem. The hotel is located in the south of the city center in the pedestrian area; all destinations in the spectacular city can be easily reached on foot.

And the best breakfast in Bulgaria in the coffee shop next door (including).","We first tried to get to Villa Antica by car, but we can no longer do that by one way. You should drive straight to the Ramada hotel (34 life a day), and then walk to Villa Antica (5 minutes).",10.0
Villa Antica,"We liked everything. I would not know what to emphasize because everything was unbeatable. The location in the center, two steps from the old city and next to restaurants, bars and the shopping area. You can walk to all the sites of interest. As soon as you step outside the door of this small hotel full of charm you already realize that it is a special place and you feel fine. The girls at the reception can't be nicer and they go out of their way to help you. The rooms are studios equipped with a kitchen and a very spacious and tastefully furnished room in an early century building fully restored but without losing the charm of past periods. Breakfast is served in Fellini cafe next to the hotel and is the best breakfast we have had during our entire stay in Bulgaria, very varied, all products of exceptional quality and all presented in an exquisite way in an atmosphere that invites you to spend hours, not wanting the time to leave. And above all, we would highlight the kindness and attention of the girls in charge of breakfast. We had breakfast for two days and the second day the waitress greeted us cone if we had been  customers for years and she already knew what kind of coffee we wanted each of the four people we made the group. In short, if you are looking for a special place to feel pampered and unique, Villa Antica is your place.

You have the impression that someone from the upper floor will fall on your head. Every step is heard in the room above you. Parking is not possible, because it is a pedestrian zone, but there is a secured parking lot nearby, which is not very cheap (34 BGN per day). Maybe another price could be negotiated for the guests.",8.0

Hotel Leipzig,"Before I state the good and positive feedback, I need to mention a few negatives. Breakfast was awfully bad. Especially on the last day of my visit: there was no buffet, so they offered breakfast from the menu. What was served was poorly prepared. The salami for example was like rubber. I took one bite and had spit it out because it was unchewable. .Also, the hotel lacks a solid maintenance schedule. So, the interior lost its glamour (looks old and unmaintained). The same applies to the furniture in the room: the sofa in the larger room (I had booked the apartment on the 11th floor) for example should have been replaced with something new and fresh years ago. But beyond all the rubbishes, there is one highlight not to ignore - something that makes this hotel unique and my favourite choice hotel in Plovdiv: the bathroom that comes with a jacuzzi.

When it came to the payment, we thought that it was already handled by booking trought the credit card that I put. But the guy told us in a very rude tone: ""we do not take money from Booking, you need to pay now!"". He really make you feel stupid, with no apparent reason. We did not reply to such person, because honestly we did not have time to waste..I don't know what kind of standards they have in Bulgaria regarding hotels, but a room that has stains in the sink, has 4 stars?

Noviz Hotel,"The staff was actually really friendly and helpful which was encouraging and the only reason I didn't want to report any of the negative items. Mainly because the reception staff can't fix these and is not responsible for the general up-keeping of the hotel. We only needed a place to crash at for a few hours of sleep after a wedding, so spared them the blushes.","Bits of somebody's nails were found on the floor on our second day. The iron provided by the property leaked, had no steam and damaged one of my shirts because of the dirty water leaking from it. The replacement iron was older than myself and the maid which provided it apologised explaining all Irons are like the one I have been given. .The door to the bathroom had a 10-15cm gap at the bottom. The bath sink was partially blocked. The curtains have not been washed or cleaned for a while. I tried opening a window and it was full of spider webs and other small insects - definitely not been cleaned recently. .The bed sheets were old too and felt like hospital ones. The pillow was rock solid and hard. The air-con is at least 10-15 years old, so it's extremely noisy..I'd expect the rooms in this property to cost no more than 40-50 leva a night based on all the issues described above, but I get how pricing and demand works, so they can get away with it for now. .If you got nowhere else to stay and need a roof, hot water and a flat surface to lay on like we did - go for it, otherwise look elsewhere.",4.2

It features a digital TV as well with most of the popular Bulgarian channels. The location is superb and I find it almost equally distant from the city centre and the main bus and train stations. By walk, it will take you around 15 minutes to reach both places. The price was absolutely spot on and it is a great value for your money - even though I stayed during the pandemic times, where the prices were low in general, but if they manage to keep it as it is, I would have no doubts, but to recommend this place. I had a really pleasant and seamless stay.

However, the spaces are quite narrow so good parking skills required. .Only a few TV channels available..I stayed for 4 nights and no one cleaned the room during that time.

We've made 3 circles in the quarter before to find it, actually after calling the reception desk for help.

Hotel BLVD 7,"- Nothing, nothing.","We expected more from a ""renovated"" room. By ""renovated"" you mean ""completely renovated"". The hotel management seems to understand this meaning, such as painting old furniture and doors and replacing the glass-enclosed bathroom curtain, which is more about decorating than protecting the floor from getting wet. The purity was beyond criticism. The bathroom floor, as well as the room floor, was covered with hair from previous guests. The sheets were yellow stains. The external bodies of two air conditioners (ours and the one in the next room) do not allow the terrace door to be opened due to the noise and air that is emitted during the operation of the system. Although we had turned off our air conditioning, the one next door was working all the time, and there's no way we can tell the other guests to turn it off so it's not loud and we don't breathe what the outside body is breathing. It's also not normal to have 3 irons and one ironing board that the receptionist doesn't know which room she's in. Her suggestion was to try and iron the desk. It's not normal for me. Even at ¬£60. for a double room ""renovated"" in my opinion, it is not worth the price-quality ratio. I'm sorry I didn't take pictures to prove the words I wrote.

The artificial ventilation did not work properly (heated instead of cooling and air to bring).The bed linen (pumpamuster in yellow and brown) was made of synthetic fiber (polyester) the bath mat as well - a real hygiene problem, especially since both towels and bed linen had been treated with tons of textile veredlers, which is very problematic for an allergy-sufferer like me..The ""host"" saw in the guest basically an enemy, if he was not satisfied with the offered service, without however suggesting a solution. On my own request, after a sleepless night for an extra charge of 54 Leva I got a room with a window and air conditioning. The host himself has not suggested a solution. The mattress was just as ""underground"" as in the original room. On the sleepless night I found out that this ""host"" is already known for this action by Tripadvisor like a colorful dog.

In addition, fresh eggs and a selection of cheese and sausage..From the hotel in the wonderful old town it is just 300 meters down to Kapana, for evening I recommend the restaurant Photo Club, a bit below the hotel.","I thought we were received warmly, instead I felt uninvited. A young woman showed me the booked room in the basement WITHOUT windows (only narrow tilting windows without a view), so I was disappointed. She again said that was in the description and the guests would not read it......well, it says that the room had artificial lighting, the fine print is not interpreted as a basement at least straight away. .After I chose another room, the price changed...the owner's wife was on the phone with him, giving her daughter prices, which she again told me, with the result that it was more and more expensive. .So: with this knowledge I would never book here, I felt unwelcoming and ripped off, not hospitable at all!!.There are 30 Bulgarian programs on the TV, but not a single international one!",6.2

We had to move in without our luggage, only with toiletries, because climbing suitcases down narrow and winding stairs made it impossible. Because of the chimney and the nailed windows, it was very hot on the fourth floor, and we asked the owner to turn on the air conditioning. He did it a little reluctant and a little complicated, and in the middle of the night, we found out that he cut the power, probably for savings. The refrigerator was something that was homemade on the VW brand that made too much noise. Overall, the experience was definitely unpleasant and we couldn't wait until morning to leave.

If you want to cook, you can find anything you might need to cook, even spices. The apartment is very convenient for shopping, there are both 24-hour shops and a large shop on the corner. The apartment is a 10-minute walk from the centre of Plovdiv, which is a great advantage. There's a hairdryer if you want to take a bath.

If you want to cook, you can find anything you might need to cook, even spices. The apartment is very convenient for shopping, there are both 24-hour shops and a large shop on the corner. The apartment is a 10-minute walk from the centre of Plovdiv, which is a great advantage. There's a hairdryer if you want to take a bath. This is the second time I've come here, and I'd certainly like to visit again, because it always exceeds my expectations. The landlord is smiling, friendly and friendly. Everything was perfect.

It is not bad to hire more staff at the hot spots - because waiting in line for an hour for food is not good either..Hotel guests are required to enter separately from outside visitors, but this option is not used. The aquapark needs renovation - there were damaged surfaces in the children's pools, which led to a lot of stings, a lot of the big skate belts were broken handles, which is unacceptable, lack of sanitary materials - toilet paper and napkins in the toilets.
