7,9,9,Festa Panorama Hotel,"Superb outdoor pool. Cleanest outdoor pool water I've ever seen - no red eyes, itching or any feeling of chemicals. Even the seagulls drank form it in the evening - that's nature approving the quality of the water! The outdoor pool was very well organized - 3 big sections for Children (60cm depth), Playing (120cm depth), Swimming (150cm depth). The pool bar had free ice cream for the all-inclusive program - nice surprise for the kids. There were enough sun beds for everyone, even on busy days. After 15:00 PM there are shady areas in all 3 sections of the pool. As a bonus - it had great panoramic view of the sea and the bay. .There was a mini-club (children place with all sorts of toys) and even a child disco in the evening. The disco was highly engaging for children and required a lot of jumping and moving around - great for tiring them between dinner and bed time. Animators were super cool and even helped us organize a birthday party for our older child (turning 3). They allowed us to bring in a cake and sang a happy birthday song for us at the start of the child disco..The food in the all-inclusive program was plenty, various and delicious. Even the pool bar had free ice cream - nice surprise. The beer was good and also free. .The children (1y and 3y) stayed for free. We had extra bed and a crib provided in the room (requested during booking). .Room was clean and big enough for 2 adults with 2 children. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom was spacious. Towels were clean, no signs of wear & tear. .We had everything needed, absolutely no reason to go outside the hotel..","Parking was a nightmare! At the moment of our stay it was not possible to book a parking spot at the hotel's parking. .What is worse - the personnel at the reception had no idea where else we could park and what are parking rules in the town of Nessebar in general. There were some parking spots in a small alley, right outside the fence of the hotel, but when asked about parking there - nobody at the hotel seemed to know, even at the reception. We had to ask random people walking around until we find a local, who explained the numbered parking spaces are payed and reserved for locals living nearby. Some of those numbered parking spaces indeed had ""Reserved in local government"" signs - seemed legit to be applicable for all the numbered ones. It was OK to park on a non-numbered space, but literally all of those were already taken. We were told about a nearby parking place organized by the local government, at around 500m away from the hotel, but kept it as a last resort option (with 2 toddlers, there were a lot of bags to carry)..While waiting at the parking gate, we tried reaching the hotel trough phone, but had no luck. When searched in Google, the phone number lead to a dead end - some corporate HQ in another city and nobody even picked it up first 5 attempts. .Practically, nobody at the hotel had any idea about parking alternatives nearby. The simple question of ""where do we leave the car?"" required 30 mins of waiting at the parking gate, circling around in the alleys, talking with random strangers, several trips back and forth to the reception and pure luck at the end. We've settled on ""unloading the bags at the front door then parking somewhere else"" and while unloading someone departed and left a free parking space for us..",9.0,"Superb outdoor pool.

Big thanks to her!!! And in general, you can contact her for any question! Taxi? You are welcome ! And by the way, a taxi from the hotel is cheaper than taking in the village. Transfer? They make a discount, it turns out cheaper than on Qiwi.taxi. They are driven in a comfortable car. There is also an exchange for Levs. By the way, at a favorable rate! To Kemel Park - please! Everywhere will be taken at a good rate. Two-room suite, fresh hotel (2017), large balcony. The room has a small kitchen. With fridge , sink , kettle , microwave , and cupboards . For things 2 wardrobes - very convenient. Safe. Hairdryer in the bathroom. Iron on request at the reception. In general, there is everything for life)) Special thanks to the maid Valya. I cleaned like at home, to the conscience! Towels are changed every day. Linen every 3 days. The hotel has a restaurant , on TripAdvisor in a good rating ! There are breakfasts. There's no such thing !"

It was very uncomfortable lying on plain wood and we wish we knew in advance, it should be written somewhere before booking.

We suggest free sunbeds at the beach which now aren't. Another misunderstanding that had its resolution is breakfast. We saw here that it was not a buffet one but a menu and we were told in advance that we could choose whatever we wanted from the menu during our communication with the hotel management.

But if you want all this, at Aprodithe Hotel you can find them all, and something extra ... That's why we'll be back in September. (The text is a pamphlet, who doesn't understand it, stay home!)

Entrance into the water is shallow and even 30-40 meters it is still around 1meter high.. in our room (C305) we had bad smell in bathroom- especially when it was more windy outside. I guess it is something with pipe system as this is what reception told us. We closed bathroom door and living room door and it was fine then. .So it was bothering when bathroom had to be used (but was not a constant 24/7 smell) but did not disrupt overall staying experience as most of the time we were not in the room anyway..

2008,2438,4128,Zevs Residence,"Cleanliness everywhere. Staff involvement more than anywhere (we didn't travel much, so we have a comparison period). Generous space (I had an apartment with a balcony, I understand that it exists without a balcony, but just as generous). Large, bright windows, but also blinds for a long sleep. The kitchen is clean and equipped as an apartment should look. The ""real"" refrigerator. I mean, a big cloud at home. :) Large, comfortable bed. I also saw that they have everything they need for families with small children, including babies. Generous storage spaces. Our pool is very big, but deep enough and spacious. The water is constantly checked, cleaned, the filters changed in the morning, I saw personally. Hygiene and anti-covid conditions are respected, although their awareness is more of an instinct, somehow relaxed, without making you feel pressured. You feel on vacation, but still safe. The parking lot is small, but no one suffers. Mr. Jivko knew exactly when to leave and how best to position ourselves so that everyone had access and flexibility. Quiet, in principle. But this cannot be guaranteed, as I said, a situation as common as possible for any building that does not consist of a single ... apartment. :) Do not understand that the sound insulation of the walls or doors is poor. But if you sit on the balcony, you obviously hear what's going on in another nearby balcony or outside by the pool. The room was clean and tidy - ours was with a shower. The villa area is very quiet and close to the beach, as well as most of the terraces - all open and very tender, plus a self-service as flour. Contrary to popular belief, we actually had internet when we needed it. :) It must be mentioned that the dedication of the host is far above the standards, that everything possible is done to satisfy customers, and this with a naturalness and serenity that make you feel really relaxed.","No matter how hard I try, I can't find any dissatisfaction with our stay at Zevs Residence. But because this is the complaints section, I would like to make a few clarifications. I read in some reviews about the road without a sidewalk outside the apartment building, or about the fact that the linen would not change daily, or about the lazy wi-fi. However, it seems to me some exaggerations: on that street it is neither dangerous nor inconvenient, it is simply a normal alley and the cars are only those of the residents and those accommodated, practically hardly driving. I don't know if the bedding changed daily is as normal as some people find it. The change of towels was done, of course. Instead, I noticed that at this unit, if you ask for something, measures are taken on the spot, with care, with a smile on your face, and in full. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly. It was not something to ask for and not to be offered even more. We asked for details about the direction of the old town and were immediately offered all the options to get there, plus Mr. Jivko's bonus: ""If none of them suits you, I'll take you with my car."" This is their attitude. The cleaning staff - the same smile and promptness. Of course, I'm the kind of customer who, if he's unhappy, says no, keeps quiet and then writes in the review. And communication and dedication like at Zevs I have never seen anywhere, although I have not traveled much. Indeed, Wi-Fi is not Speedy Gonzales. Delay a few seconds. Sometimes 10. Tragic, I admit. In these infinite seconds you can think well and even come to a conclusion about some options: to stay in the room to surf the internet, or to go out to contemplate the surroundings ...? If you have an emergency at work and need urgent mail, talk openly with Jivko.",10.0,"Cleanliness everywhere.

Generous space (I had an apartment with a balcony, I understand that it exists without a balcony, but just as generous). Large, bright windows, but also blinds for a long sleep. The kitchen is clean and equipped as an apartment should look. The ""real"" refrigerator. I mean, a big cloud at home. :) Large, comfortable bed. I also saw that they have everything they need for families with small children, including babies. Generous storage spaces. Our pool is very big, but deep enough and spacious. The water is constantly checked, cleaned, the filters changed in the morning, I saw personally. Hygiene and anti-covid conditions are respected, although their awareness is more of an instinct, somehow relaxed, without making you feel pressured. You feel on vacation, but still safe. The parking lot is small, but no one suffers. Mr. Jivko knew exactly when to leave and how best to position ourselves so that everyone had access and flexibility. Quiet, in principle. But this cannot be guaranteed, as I said, a situation as common as possible for any building that does not consist of a single ... apartment. :) Do not understand that the sound insulation of the walls or doors is poor. But if you sit on the balcony, you obviously hear what's going on in another nearby balcony or outside by the pool. The room was clean and tidy - ours was with a shower. The villa area is very quiet and close to the beach, as well as most of the terraces - all open and very tender, plus a self-service as flour. Contrary to popular belief, we actually had internet when we needed it. :) It must be mentioned that the dedication of the host is far above the standards, that everything possible is done to satisfy customers, and this with a naturalness and serenity that make you feel really relaxed. No matter how hard I try, I can't find any dissatisfaction with our stay at Zevs Residence. But because this is the complaints section, I would like to make a few clarifications. I read in some reviews about the road without a sidewalk outside the apartment building, or about the fact that the linen would not change daily, or about the lazy wi-fi. However, it seems to me some exaggerations: on that street it is neither dangerous nor inconvenient, it is simply a normal alley and the cars are only those of the residents and those accommodated, practically hardly driving. I don't know if the bedding changed daily is as normal as some people find it. The change of towels was done, of course. Instead, I noticed that at this unit, if you ask for something, measures are taken on the spot, with care, with a smile on your face, and in full. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly. It was not something to ask for and not to be offered even more. We asked for details about the direction of the old town and were immediately offered all the options to get there, plus Mr. Jivko's bonus: ""If none of them suits you, I'll take you with my car."" This is their attitude. The cleaning staff - the same smile and promptness. Of course, I'm the kind of customer who, if he's unhappy, says no, keeps quiet and then writes in the review. And communication and dedication like at Zevs I have never seen anywhere, although I have not traveled much. Indeed, Wi-Fi is not Speedy Gonzales. Delay a few seconds. Sometimes 10. Tragic, I admit. In these infinite seconds you can think well and even come to a conclusion about some options: to stay in the room to surf the internet, or to go out to contemplate the surroundings ...? If you have an emergency at work and need urgent mail, talk openly with Jivko."

Next time, maybe :) Keep improving!."

The rooms are not big, but I saw smaller ones at 4 stars. Every day Iva, the lady who takes care of the hotel (the good man at everything), comes in to make the beds, to vacuum if necessary and to take out the garbage. Iva is also a good friend for tourists staying in hotels. The hotel does not have the possibility to serve meals. However, there are many terraces / restaurants / taverns in the old Nesebar so there is no question of meals. The area where the hotel is located is a quiet one and has 2 small shops nearby, but well stocked. The hotel can be reached relatively quickly from the paid parking lot, on the stairs behind the children's playground. The landmark for entering the street that will lead you to the hotel is one of the grocery stores I was talking about, a store located 5-6 meters from the entrance on that street. In 3 minutes you should reach a museum church, the church of St. Theodor, turn right and at the gate with an anchor is the hotel. Yes, the lady who greets you at the reception is not English speaking, but she has a voice translation application on her phone and she is excellent. In addition, Iva can also recommend terraces where you can eat well. At the hotel reception you can serve various strong drinks and a very good coffee, beer, water and juices at the store price. For those of you who have been to Nesebarul Vechi and thought it didn't have a bigger beach, you should know that there is a bigger beach near the amphitheater here. There are also lifeguards and there is a lot of peace. The disadvantage is that in the water, right at the entrance to the sea, there are stones, but for those who want to swim about 3-4 meters from the shore, the stones are gone. Also regarding the beach, I tell you that there are portions at the entrance to the sea where there are no stones and children can enter there without any problems.","This year was extremely crowded during the day, many tourists who came to visit.",10.0,"We liked absolutely everything.

It would be great if breakfast could be added. Keep in mind that the walls are thin, so the neighbors will be heard, but this is not such a minus, more like a warning. In the shower, it would be possible to replace rusty soap holders with plastic ones, at least - more aesthetically pleasing, practical, and then it would not be necessary to change them. It looks like the hotel is going to be redecorated, so I think everything will be much better! Good luck!"

I staid in the hotel some five years ago and the this last stay was totally different experience. It was wonderful silent NY night where you can stay awake and look at the stars, and smell the fresh and little salty air sipping a good drink.. "

The car was closed because the alley in front of the hotel happened to be under construction, so it was easy for me to lie down. I'm sure it's a public parking lot (10m or so) down a few steps from the front of the hotel. There is a bathtub. Clean room. Air conditioning that works well (Daikin). Perhaps because of the off-season, the restaurant wasn't open at night. disappointing. What is it like to leave the corridor cleaning tools out even during the off-season?"

Do not park in the parking lot of the 5 star hotel because you pay 10 BGN per day, while in the parking lot of the other 2 hotels (4 star) you do not pay anything. Otherwise, the organization was OK for the given situation (COVID), if you also respect the imposed conditions."
