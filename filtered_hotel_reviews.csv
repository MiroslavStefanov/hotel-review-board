For 5 days the room has not been cleaned once. For 5 days, bed linen has been changed once. It says there's a doctor - there isn't, but we're charged for one? It says there's a hairdryer in every room, and there isn't. There's no evacuation plan. There's no fire system in the rooms. I didn't get a single receipt after every payment. Apart from the difference in hotels, there is a difference in prices. The higher price was paid for the nicer hotel, and we were staying at the MINERY. Two days without lights in the bathroom, which was also, to put it mildly, terrible. .The most amazing thing... my husband and I witnessed a conversation between the hotel manager (a blonde lady) and future hotel guests. In this conversation, the manager apologized for another ""messy booking"" and that people would not be staying in Salena Beach, but in Salena again. After hanging up the phone, the blonde lady gave strict orders to the receptionist, and I quote: We're going to be in Salena Beach housing foreigners and people with money.

The water is extremely high flow, there was a bath, the TVs are big, the air conditioning was doing a good job, there were enough contacts everywhere.

The nearest towel rack was 10 feet from the sink! There was a huge window that was meant to be in the bathtub looking at the sea. Okay, that's smart. You should have put a curtain on the toilet so that the kids on the playground don't have to see it. - There was no dryer for God's sake... towels and swimsuits dried up on the chairs and on the windows.- There was no bath cap - we asked and got it the second day after the cleaning lady at 6:30.

Worse still, there was no 4G range and had to be talked on the terrace..- The food was delicious for the first two days. Nevertheless, it was extremely cheap, poor, tough meat - basically as much as there was anything to eat there. The restaurant looks like a roadside joint with transparent roofs. Breakfast was like any other 3-star hotel with nothing different and varied. The pancakes were super-delicious, the coffee was awful with a taste of milk nuts and often instead of milk, water was poured..- The drinks from every bar were water with something - vague what-- I pay attention - Bulgarian alcohol was paid!.- The A La Carte option that was included in the price was off the table for us because I quote, ""Well, there's no room!"".- On the beach, there are sun loungers that are adjacent to the hotel and which include catunis with other people..- My wife is pregnant. The luggage we had was not small. We had to drag him from the entrance to the room. Help, no!.- The foreign guests of the hotel were extremely large pigs, impudent, bumpy, noisy and terrible. Midnight slamming doors, breaking glasses and ""booking"" on deck chairs with towels since 6:00 a.m..- Hallway light after 7:00. It was a vacation - he was gone. We lit up with phones..- For £1,200.

The balcony is spacious, but the door to the balcony without a mosquito net, at night you have to either close it or sleep after applying a mosquito spray. The room has a kettle, tea and instant coffee (we didn’t drink, so I don’t know if they replenish it), a mini-fridge, a shower in the bath, towels, gels in abundance, everything is quite new. There are a lot of sun loungers by the pool, the hotel does not issue towels for the pool / beach, so you need your own. The hotel will especially please lovers of a relaxing holiday, there are no discos nearby, after 22.00 there is silence))) It is close to the sea, there are good granite steps, but then you have to walk along the sand to the hotel beach. Or go along the path and go down the steep wooden steps, but immediately to the hotel's sun loungers. The sand on the beach, by the way, is amazingly clean (it is sifted in the evening). The food is standard for a Bulgarian foursome, tasty enough, no frills, but you can feed a baby up to a year old (vegetarians and raw foodists will also find something to eat). Animators entertain the children, but they communicate almost exclusively in Bulgarian. The lobby bar with ""all inclusive"" is open until 23.00, then for a fee. Lovers of natural coffee, of course, will have to look for it in the city, in the hotel there is a typical gruel).

Apart Hotel Primavera 2,"The location of the hotel is quite interesting! Located in the centre of Primorsko, yet a peaceful location with various views of the lively street!The young girls at the reception were extremely friendly and willing to help out with anything to help guests.  The restaurant where we had breakfast is just a few steps from the hotel.Breakfast was varied and sufficient in every way. It was nice that everyone could make coffee and other hot drinks on a professional machine of very good quality! Great scrambled eggs every morning too!","Air conditioning should have been cleaned before the season started, not after guests check in. With the pandemic, the owners are supposed to have had enough time to prepare for the season, not to find cable box torn off the wall, and we can't watch anything all the way through the entire stay except massive snow. Breakfast must be accompanied by a serious attention to the quality of the sausages, cheese and cheese. The quality of these products was not even at a satisfactory level. There was no bread mix. They did. They only offered wheat bread, white and typhus, i.e. the same product only with a difference in colour. It would be good to think of rye bread, lime, whole wheat and protein bread. I would like to comment not to be taken as criticism but as a recommendation for improving the quality of the services offered.Perhaps with a slight price change, you can iron out a few of the shortcomings I mentioned. For the price we paid, not even a small part of the above could be expected. I missed something. It would be nice if the bottom sheets of the bedrooms and the sofas were rubber bands, not the oldest of the Balkanhurists, who gather in the middle of the bed of a ball and wake up on an unpackaged mattress. With little effort, this place can be perfect for tourists and a favourite location! There's potential in this place!",8.0

The third bed we paid for turned out to be a folding armchair. The bathroom had a shower headset, but it couldn't be attached to the wall. The room was not ready at the check-in time.",3.8
Apart Hotel Primavera 2,"Location. South Beach is about 5 minutes walk. To the central square with a concert venue as well. There are many catering points nearby, several currency exchanges and convenience stores (but prices are lower in large supermarkets near the water park), on the contrary - a large store with all sorts of tourist stuff. The room is quite spacious - 4 people did not push. Carried out cosmetic repairs. Good double-glazed windows - you can't hear music from the bar and drunken songs. There is a lot of furniture (tables, bedside tables, wardrobe, large table), but the shelves partially fail, and the legs of the table are not completely screwed - it staggers. The reception staff is friendly, 2 out of 3 speak Russian. Free Wi-Fi at good enough speed. Hot water from a large boiler (120 l?), so always available. We were always enough for 4 people. There is a kitchen with a minimum of utensils. Large fridge with freezer. On the balcony - a little drying. The air conditioner, though apparently not serviced for a long time, but worked properly. A good door seal to the bathroom - did not let the smell from the sewer into the room. Large LCD TV, there are 2 Russian channels (ORT and RTR-planet). Broken watering can in the shower was replaced without a call on the 2nd day.","Oddly enough, the location. It is not easy to find the entrance right away (especially at night) - it is in a side passage. The hotel is located in the center, so there are a lot of people on the street in the evening, there is a 24-hour bar with music nearby, so you won’t be able to sit in silence on the balcony to read a book in the evening. Then cleaning - we were met by a clean room, only with a large piece of crumbling plaster on the balcony. The next day no one cleaned up. And then they were also not cleaned every day, the floor was washed maybe 2 times (after complaints to the reception), the beds were not made, and at the end of 3 days they didn’t even take out the garbage. Tipping left - not taken. Pillows-""jellyfish"" are generally terrible! Though the linen was changed, but from time to time we got sheets instead of duvet covers, but somehow they were not left either. We also need to replace the equipment for the building - there are a lot of minor flaws: the threshold fell off - no one attached it like that. Falling out sockets, a shelf in the bathroom, an edge on the countertop, falling shelves in the closet, a staggering table will not take much work to fix and the expense for this costs a penny. There is no elevator if the room is on the 4th floor and the suitcases are heavy ... The shower is not separated from the toilet (just a drain in the floor), so I washed myself - everything is wet. A corresponding smell was constantly coming from the sewer (apparently the siphon was partially clogged with sand, but there was no one to fix it). Flies for breakfast. Food is served in a cafe nearby (the food is monotonous, inexpensive, but acceptable) without the concern of covering it from flies, and they actively use it. Isn't it possible to use covers or special insect nets from Ikea ?? They also seem to cost a bit. In general, one gets the impression of a policy of economy in the degree of petty stinginess. To top it all, a plastic chair on the balcony broke under me (and I sat straight on it). Another problem - there is nowhere to wash things (although there is a place for a washing machine). You can take a basin at the reception :) Is it so difficult to organize at least 2-3 washing machines or a laundry service for money?",5.4

There could be some kind of flyer on which he has information. You walk into a small, unobtrusive alley in a dark, depressing, dirty lobby with a mild criminal effect. As we were walking up to the studio, there was furniture, nails sticking out, a strange smell. The studio is like the pictures! Spacious and large, but it smelled like mold or something, but not pleasant (sometimes the flavours do wonders) The furniture's fine. There were three coffee cups, four of us. There were no glass. The bathroom was big, it looked clean, but the muss was... like I wrote up. The sink was running down the drain. The bedroom was big and comfortable, and the sofa bed was okay. The terrace is nice and big, but the table on it is old and gnarly, the chairs were fine.

In relation to the yacht tour provided, it should be noted that we have been proposed to do it at 19:30, then it was determined that the arrangement with the hotel did not include this hour of walking with the CORBET, but it did happen after we explained to the captain that it wasn't our fault.

The problem is the incompetent staff that lacks any experience in tourism and customer service. They poorly understand Bulgarian. If you’re from Russia, then you won’t have problems. These guys are from Russia (not very sure how they turned out in Bulgarian- almost certain that they don’t have work permits). .Whatever they promised, nothing happened. We had to ask them consistently to do some things - like do an invoice document for the payment. They are trying to avoid official documents so that they can hide turnover and taxes consequently. .Also, they are not taking into account quite hours - usually they clean with vacuum cleaner between 14:00 and 16:00, which also points out their lack of competence in tourism and customer service. .Breakfast - well, they are offering breakfast only if it’s included in the price or you pay additional 4 Euros per person. The main problem however, I which has relation to Booking.com as well, is the fact that no matter for how many people you do the reservation for the property (in our case for 3), you get as a final result a reservation for 2 and breakfast for 2 respectively. This is a cheap scam!!!.The owners of the property should know that such an incompetent staff, lacking the a and b of tourism and customer service can only bring negative feedback and experience. Also I’m certain that trying to hide turnover and taxes and possibly using not local staff without working permits will arise issues with the authorities at a particular moment..Finally, learn that the customer is always right!

You have to do several circles in the area to find a place.

APART-HOTEL Stamopolu Lux с изглед към морето,"Excellent location, close to the beach and the centre, quiet and peaceful. Luxuriously furnished room. Matrac medium hard. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need, dishes, glasses and utensils. The price is acceptable. I never went to the pool, but he looked clean and there were plenty of sun loungers. We were on the ground floor towards the street, but there's a little yard and a hedge that gives you some comfort, and there's tables with chairs in front of the rooms.","In seven days, they didn't clean the room, they didn't take out the trash, not to mention ""extras"" like toilet paper, shampoo, clean towels and underwear. On day five, I couldn't stand it, so I asked for at least a change of my towels. Twenty minutes later, a basket of clean towels and sheets appeared in front of my room. After an hour, I changed them myself because I was tired of waiting. Then the underwear basket was in front of the room until the end of the next day. To clarify that this is not, in practice, a hotel but an apartment complex in which some of the apartments were bought (by Russians) and non-marketable (like the one I was in) are given to tourists. Unmarketable because they're all northern and the sun is out of your sight. The clothes dried for a day or two.",6.2

Perla Sun Park Hotel,I’m visiting this hotel for 4 years now with my family and our experience has always been excellent. This year they were very well prepared with all the COVID requirements in order to provide a safe and pleasant vacation. I’m very grateful to everyone for being there in this tough times greeting us with a smile and providing a pleasant stay - from management to staff to bai Ivan :). Everyone was very friendly and provided excellent service! One of the waitresses stands up with her constant smile and willingness to help - her name is Ani. The amenities and rooms in the resort were well maintained and the access to the beach was very easy as always by raft with the excellent service of  Ivan. .The weather in Primorsko this year was perfect again that’s another reason we always go there. .We’ll come back for sure and hopefully many more tourists in 2021..,,10.0

But that was pretty much it..","- the room was not detailed and cleaned properly upon our arrival. The light fixture on the balcony was hanging on the electrical wire. The paint on the railing is falling apart, there was a lot of spider nets all over the balcony. .- housekeeping used to come every 2 days, this year they would just clean the trash and restock toilet paper. Clean sheet and towels you would get every 3 days if you are lucky. .- the umbrellas at the pool were very outdated - some ripped off and some broken. .- the quality of the food was very low - lots of the dishes were just a bag of frozen food that was broiled or fried. I’ve seen dishes from lunch served during dinner in a different form. The variety was just not there..- the all inclusive liqueur is the lowest possible quality that can be purchased, which is typical for 2 and 3 star resorts.  .- public restrooms were very often out of soap which is unacceptable during the current COVID situation. .I do hope things will get better, because I love vacationing at this property..",6.0

The staff is very disoriented.The drinks are very low quality, could have been at least medium, the Sophia wine, for example, is the cheapest possible cheapest and bad taste. Five hotels can't afford that... they go through checks once they give you those stars, but that's unacceptable. The food in the restaurant is not responding either - the low-fat cheese, the sandwiches lame, for three days there was no food, only one meat was thrown at the grill first or baked if it wasn't eaten the next day with sauce and the same thing every day..Your hotel is very cute, and I'd still be happy to come if we could get some life and health promotions next year, but never for £500. per person. Management is very lame, people are good, but they don't think, they don't rationalize, like they're set up and they find it and they do it. I guess that depends a lot on the salary. Can't have the poor bartender on the bar and a waiter.How can he... and in five hotels, the manager explain to me that the frappuccino wasn't all inclusive because it was made with milk, which was expensive, but they could make me a coffee with dry milk. It's ridiculous and embarrassing. Yes, rooms are perfect, but the overall experience doesn't match the price you cashier from people and offer much better service elsewhere. Only five rooms, the other three max..Maybe you should consider getting better prices and adjusting them down to fill the hotel. The pandemic is no excuse for bad service and half the stuff that's not working, at reception you can't even pay with a card, a porter isn't, animation isn't, spa isn't working, etc.,is like this, reduce prices for people!""",8.0

Unorganized, they cut off my toaster while the bread was in there because they didn't know there was one. In the attempt to communicate, we did not agree, because apparently third-rate Russian tourists were rated more important to the hotel than Bulgarian and Bulgarian were not among the languages they speak. In the room, with the view, the hair dryer was not working, the bathroom kit was also lacking basic toiletries. There was also a frustration at the reception of my question, ""Where's the restaurant? and ""Do you work on free breakfast?"" - I felt the lady was worried that I would go down with the child and eat for free, since we're not settled yet.

We were very well received and the staff was exemplary. On September 8, St. Mary's Day, I found an almond flake cake in the room and a greeting card for my daughter named Mary. On September 11, being the anniversary of the relationship between me and my wife, I wanted to prepare something but the hotel management wanted to give us a pleasant memory so for that date I found in the room a bottle of champagne, a basket of fresh fruit and two crystal champagne glasses. Grade 10 for how you surprised us at these events. The alcoholic beverages, juices, ice cream and natural coffee were of a very good quality compared to what is served in other hotels in Bulgaria. The table cakes were very tasty, each type having its own specific taste, not like in other places where all the cakes have the same taste. The pools are very clean, the children's entertainers are super ok and they speak fluent English, the bartenders are very nice even if most of them didn't know English (to be a bartender you don't need higher education so I understand the situation very well).","First of all, I don't think this can be called a 5 star hotel. They have work to do until they bring it to this level. We had a family room where we had to have 2 separate beds (1 13-year-old boy and 1 10-year-old girl), there were 2 separate beds but glued and due to lack of space we could not separate them, and a sofa extensible for 2 people, this is for us adults and I can say that it was extremely uncomfortable, I could not sleep in it so I spread the bedding on the floor and slept there. Another thing that bothered me a lot and was reported by other tourists that you traveled in previous years, was the lack of cutlery and dishes for which we had to wait a long time in the queue but also the fact that lunch is served one kind of soup / soup and at dinner there are several dishes (being a hotel frequented more by Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians and Hungarians, maybe this is the custom in these countries and the hotel has adapted to their requirements).",8.0
